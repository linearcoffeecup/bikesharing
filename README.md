# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

This project visualizes data for planning a bicycle sharing business in DesMoines.  The project uses data from the New York City bicycle sharing program found at <the link>.  Certain data is useful to visualize such as numbers of riders, numbers of rides, duration, and other considerations.  Some preparation of the data file (in csv format) was necessary to conver the format into dates and times for graphing purposes.  
  
Tableau was used to visualize the data and gain insights for helping to consider a similar business.  Tableau graphics not only provide visual data but also data *dimensions* such as type of bicycle rider, etc, which can be grouped and displayed in popups, legends, colors, and color gradients. Tableau graphics used in this analysis were pie charts, line charts, and heatmaps.  The tool provides a sytematic method: import data, create worksheets, create dashboards and finally use the dashboards to create a "story" for the project.  


# RESULTS
  
  Prior to seeing the story for the project, the following project elements are discussed:<br><br>

  **Pie maps** show the use of the bicycles by the number of rides.  The data contains a breakdown of rider information by gender, customer or subscriber.  *Men who are subscribers to the bicycle program are the largest bicycle users*.<br><br>

  **Line maps** show the trip duration of the bicycle ride.  *It is easy to see that rides take less thant one hour for all riders*.<br><br>

  This is a **heat map** which shows the days of the week together with the type of bicycle rider- customer or subscriber - along with the gender.  As can be seen in the more deatiled story board, *the information shows that men who are subscribers ride most on Thursdays*.<br><br>

  This is a **heat map** which adds the dimension of stoptime to the previous dimensions.  *It shows that men ride most often and in mornings and evenings*.<br><br>

  <img width="501" alt="Heatmap3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85037467/134573344-9f2ae159-9ec6-49f3-a199-d19052549f8f.png">

  This is a **heat map** which plots only the dimensions of stoptime and weekday (not gender).  *Evening and early morning are most poplular times during the week, but more rides are recorded in the evening.*<br><br>
  The story provides a more in-depth presentation of results here <link to the Tableau story>.  The story board discusses:<br>
  
  * The size of the project
  * Knowing the times to ride
  * Busy hours of the week
  * Addition rider data on days and times
  <br><br>
  Two additional maps that could be useful are:<br><br>
  * A bubble map which has dimensions of bicyle users colors and quantitative measures of size and counts.  This shows the size of the total group of riders.
  * Another useful map would be the heatmap which plots location and station (pickup or dropoff).  This would show where the most popular stations are.<br>
